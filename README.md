# React + TypeScript Ice Breaker Activity Helper

Just a small app I made for a community who wanted some support with their Ice Breaker activity.

The activity relies on participants going around asking others clues to eventually find their sitting place at a table. Participants have different caracteristics to find their place, while they are provided with clues on the different table compositions to provide others.

The app allows to create a given number of tables where users can take notes on the different clues and cross tables out when they are sure their place is elsewhere.
